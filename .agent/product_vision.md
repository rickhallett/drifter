# Product Vision

The soul of this project. What are we building and why?

---

## Project Type

What kind of thing is this?

- [ ] **Micro-software** — Market of 1, utility of 10. Too niche to be a startup. Built for joy.
- [ ] **Boring plumbing** — Glue code, integrations, data transformation. Structural, not mathematical.
- [ ] **Unstructured reality** — Messy input → structured output. Model as UI.

## Iteration Tolerance

- [ ] **"Good enough" ships** — Perfect emerges through iteration. Most projects.
- [ ] **Precision-critical** — Failure = catastrophe. Rare. Reconsider if agents are the right tool.
